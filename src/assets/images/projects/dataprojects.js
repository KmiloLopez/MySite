    descriptIndeep: `The initial state of the gameboard is an empty array with 9 elements, which is rendered in the UI as a 3x3 grid. Each move updates the gameboard stored in Redux Toolkit.

If a square is already marked, it cannot be overwritten. Each square is assigned a class based on its content, either "X" or "O," and this is displayed as a pseudo-element in the UI. A restricted class is added to the square element once it is marked.

Pseudo-elements (::before and ::after) are part of CSS, which means they don't require additional HTTP requests to load image files, reducing the page's load time.

The possible winning combinations are predefined, and with every change to the board, the current state is checked against these combinations to determine if there's a winner. If no winner is found, the game proceeds to the next turn.`,
